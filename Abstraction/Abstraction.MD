- Encapsulation
    - Putting properties and methods into related classes to keep objects concsie. 
- Abstract class you cant instantiate. 
  - This is useful when you want to enforce implementation of certain methods in the child classes.
  - Like with `Anamal class` you will never have new instances of them, but would inherit from it. 
  - abstract methods will need to be implemented in the child classes.
  - non abstract methods can just use the default method. 
- Interface
   - all methods in an interface are abstract.
   -  the difference is you can implement many interfaces but only inherit from one class.
   - all properties in a interface are static and final.
